# Signed Heat Method

`signed-heat-3d` is a C++ library implementing the [Signed Heat Method](https://nzfeng.github.io/research/SignedHeatMethod/index.html) for computing **robust signed distance fields (SDFs)** to triangle meshes, polygon meshes, and point clouds in 3D.

Python bindings to this C++ code also exist via the `signed_heat_method` package on PyPI: toggle the "C++/Python" switch at the top of this page to see documentation for the Python version.

**Sample:**

The library uses [geometry-central](https://geometry-central.net/) to manage mesh and point cloud structures.
```cpp
#include "signedheat3d/signed_heat_grid_solver.h"
#include "signedheat3d/signed_heat_tet_solver.h"

#include "geometrycentral/surface/vertex_position_geometry.h"
#include "geometrycentral/pointcloud/point_position_normal_geometry.h"

using namespace geometrycentral;
using namespace geometrycentral::surface;
using namespace geometrycentral::pointcloud;

// Assume we have some input geometry -- these are geometry-central objects.
SurfaceMesh mesh;
VertexPositionGeometry geometry;
PointPositionNormalGeometry pointGeom;

// Initalize tet mesh solver
SignedHeatTetSolver tetSolver = SignedHeatTetSolver();

// Configure some options
SignedHeat3DOptions solveOptions; // all the default options should be pretty good

// Solve!
Vector<double> sdf = tetSolver.computeDistance(geometry, solveOptions); // get distance to the mesh!
Vector<double> sdf = tetSolver.computeDistance(pointGeom, solveOptions); // get distance to the point cloud!

// Solve on a grid instead.
SignedHeatGridSolver gridSolver = SignedHeatGridSolver();
solveOptions.resolution = {64, 64, 64}; // change the resolution of the grid
Vector<double> sdf = gridSolver.computeDistance(geometry, solveOptions); // get distance to the mesh!
Vector<double> sdf = gridSolver.computeDistance(pointGeom, solveOptions); // get distance to the point cloud!
```

**Related libraries**

The Signed Heat Method has been implemented in both C++ and Python, in 2D and in 3D.

* If you're interested in using the Signed Heat Method *on* 2D surface domains, rather than in 3D space, the method has been implemented in [geometry-central](https://geometry-central.net) for [triangle mesh domains](https://geometry-central.net/surface/algorithms/signed_heat_method/), [polygon mesh domains](https://geometry-central.net/surface/algorithms/polygon_heat_solver/#signed-geodesic-distance), and [point cloud domains](https://geometry-central.net/pointcloud/algorithms/heat_solver/#signed-geodesic-distance). A demo project exists at [signed-heat-demo](https://github.com/nzfeng/signed-heat-demo).
* Likewise, Python bindings to the geometry-central C++ code has been implemented in the Python package [potpourri3d](https://github.com/nmwsharp/potpourri3d).
